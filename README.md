# FSM Traffic Light Controller in Verilog HDL

## Overview

This project implements a traffic light controller system using Verilog HDL, employing a finite state machine (FSM) to manage traffic light sequences. Designed for simulation and verification in Xilinx Vivado, this project demonstrates efficient state management and timing control for traffic lights.

## Features

- Finite State Machine (FSM) design for traffic light control
- Modular Verilog HDL code
- Timing sequences and state transitions accurately simulated
- Well-commented code for clarity

## Files

- `Traffic_Light_Controller.v` - Main Verilog HDL module for the traffic light controller
- `testbench.v` - Testbench for simulating the traffic light controller
- `README.md` - This file

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/FSM_Traffic_Light_Controller.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xilinx Vivado.
3. Compile and simulate the `Traffic_Light_Controller.v` module to verify functionality.
